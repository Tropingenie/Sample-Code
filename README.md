# Sample-Code
A collection of public C++ code to demonstrate my coding abilities. All code in this repository is written by me
from scratch, except where noted otherwise, and has been verified to compile in a Linux environment. Extensive
testing is not garunteed, but each piece of code is verified using a limited number of test cases.

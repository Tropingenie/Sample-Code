# Sample-Code
A collection of public C++ code to demonstrate my coding abilities. All code in this repository is written by me from scratch, except where noted otherwise, and has been verified to compile in a Linux environment. Extensive testing is not garunteed, but each piece of code is verified using a limited number of test cases.

Each file is a self-contained piece of code, and thus will have a main function in order to test and demonstrate the functions of each task. The tasks are based off of prompts found across the internet, and as such have the conditions and sources specified at the top of each file.
